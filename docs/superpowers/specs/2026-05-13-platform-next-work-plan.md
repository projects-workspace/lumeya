# Lumeya milestone plan — M3 hosted compatibility and release handoff (2026-10-01)

The sole implementation snapshot is [PROJECT_STATE.md](../../../PROJECT_STATE.md). This plan records milestone decisions; the original May plan below is historical context and does not authorize its private-platform/account features.

| Milestone | Decision | Scope/result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M1 | Accepted by the user | Public discovery foundation and browser QA, baseline `3886eb0` + `4b908fd`; continue HEAD without resetting. |
| M2 | Locally accepted | Existing real service/contact paths and a demonstrated private operator receipt → clarification/review → explicit approval → generated publication → reviewed correction flow. Persistence, retries, rejection/anonymous boundaries, errors and desktop/mobile/keyboard checks passed. Remote receipt/delivery and first real provider editorial approval remain separately unverified. |
| M3 | Local SQL checkpoint accepted; hosted acceptance pending | Preserve the implemented 0017 migration and retrying forms at and after `28e6513`. Actual local PostgreSQL checks passed against reconstructed 0016 prerequisites. Hosted table/RPC equivalence, receipt persistence, worker delivery, retention and release remain unverified. |

M1 and M2 remain accepted as recorded in [PROJECT_STATE.md](../../../PROJECT_STATE.md). Local M2 preserves the static catalogue/request contract, existing CLI and loopback preview; synthetic publication used isolated temporary copies. No CMS, dashboard, My Space or Provider Space was introduced. One existing Lila offer/contact remains the sourced presentation example; ecological/craft services remain missing.

The [existing verification record and demo/tester guide](../../verification.md) distinguish the accepted local SQL checkpoint from hosted evidence. On 2026-10-01, public asset hashes again matched `eb0fda8`, Join returned 404, and the hosted form script still lacked the keyed RPC. Supabase's mapped account, exact Lumeya ref and Production overview were verified read-only; the overview reported Healthy and “No migrations.” The public Functions list showed the legacy ten-argument RPC and claim/expiry functions as Definer, with no keyed RPC or internal helper. This establishes that the new client cannot activate against that endpoint state. The full table/function/grant prerequisites remain unread, so compatibility for applying 0017 is **unknown**. Vercel's Production Branch and deployed SHA remain the dated 2026-09-30 observations; matching public assets do not freshly prove either setting. See PROJECT_STATE.md for current evidence and usage.

## Next unfinished work and release sequence

1. **Finish read-only hosted compatibility.** On the existing dedicated project `ccwvyjszlrrluzplizsu`, collect only the request table's column types/nullability/defaults, check/primary-key constraints, indexes, RLS/policies and table/column grants; the legacy and keyed public RPC signatures/definitions/owners/ACLs/security modes/search paths; the internal helper; worker claim/expiry functions; relevant migration history; and retention scheduler metadata. Avoid private rows and mutation-function calls. Compare these facts with the columns and security contract used by 0017. Classify compatible, incompatible with exact differences, or unknown. Missing readable metadata holds release. Neither the empty migration summary nor the reconstructed legacy chain proves schema equivalence.
2. **Apply the backend only with separate authorization.** Once the current schema is proven compatible, use an authorized migration path to apply only `bot/migrations/0017_idempotent_public_discovery_requests.sql`. Check any already-existing retry column/index/helper for a conflicting definition before application. Do not reset a database, replay 0016 or the legacy chain, or change infrastructure to match branding. Verify the resulting function/index/ACL contract and PostgREST visibility before frontend activation.
3. **Authorize controlled hosted receipt checks.** Verify persistence, sequential/concurrent same-key retries, generic conflict with the original unchanged, distinct keys under rate limiting, legacy compatibility and anonymous table denial. The existing `bot/tests/live-public-mvp.mjs` harness requires a positively verified existing non-production branch and rejects Production. Its use is optional; do not create a branch or weaken its guard. A check on the dedicated Production project instead needs explicit authorization naming the synthetic request/retry scope, permission for any worker notification, and the synthetic-row cleanup scope. This pass authorizes none of those writes or messages.
4. **Prove worker and retention operations.** Identify the actual Lumeya worker host/process, its configured poll interval and target, and safe execution evidence. Source defaults are a 60-second poll, batches of 20 and an eight-claim cap. Repository source and Vercel's exclusion of `bot/` do not establish uptime or Telegram delivery. Confirm the 90-day expiry function's service-role-only grant, an active scheduler/caller and execution evidence; do not run cleanup merely to inspect configuration. Receipt persistence and operator delivery require separate acceptance.
5. **Release the frontend after the backend passes.** Obtain explicit permission for the chosen push/deployment target; Preview also deploys. Reverify Vercel's actual Production Branch, deployment SHA and alias before triggering release. Reuse the existing four-minute demo and guest desktop/mobile/keyboard tester guide after the authorized deployment. Real provider identity/source approval and first real editorial intake/publication remain operator acceptance; the existing Lila record is the supplied demonstration and ecological/craft content remains missing.
6. **Disable intake safely if release must be held or reversed.** In an authorized frontend config release, set both `window.LumeyaConfig.supabaseUrl` and `supabasePublishableKey` to empty strings in `public-config.js`, then reload and verify the existing unconfigured/contact states. This also disables readers using the shared live Supabase client; verify their unconfigured state. Preserve stored retry keys and request data. An uncertain receipt must retain its key and withhold a second manual send. A rollback to the pre-M3 frontend alone restores the duplicate-prone legacy RPC, so keep online intake disabled when reverting those assets. Leave the additive backend column/index/functions intact and fix forward; do not drop them as a client rollback.

The user restored the foreground Functions page and a partial metadata read passed. Remaining access needs restoration of this chat's existing Chrome browser-control connection/request-header-policy loading with the same accounts and permissions; native page/definition capture becomes unreadable after navigation. No new account, credentials or cloud branch is requested. The goal remains active until hosted compatibility and the requested current deployment metadata can be inspected. M3 remains pending until separately authorized hosted end-to-end acceptance. Do not resume the historical account, bookings, reminders or cabinet tasks below from this plan alone.

# Historical Santiago Platform: Current State And Next Work Plan (2026-05-13)

## Current State

The platform now has the working backend foundation for the first real MVP:

- Telegram profile login works through `get_profile_by_telegram_id`.
- The live database has services, events, favorites, subscriptions, reminder notifications, bookings, and submissions.
- Two public services exist in Supabase.
- One public test event exists for calendar and reminder testing.
- Saving an event creates a favorite, an active event reminder subscription, and two pending reminder jobs.
- The cabinet can show the logged-in admin profile and saved event reminder state.
- The Telegram bot is the main operational backend for role flows, submissions, and reminder delivery.

## Product Direction From User

Admin work should stay Telegram-first for now. The admin does not need a full website admin panel immediately.

Content will come later, after the mechanics work reliably.

The website should focus on being useful for visitors, residents, mentors, and later content discovery. The bot can continue doing heavy admin actions, while the site can show states and activate bot flows where needed.

## What We Still Do Not Have

### Mentor Profile System

The database can store users with an instructor role, and the bot can collect submissions, but the platform does not yet have a complete mentor profile system.

Missing:

- public mentor profile records connected to users;
- mentor profile listing on the website;
- profile publish/approve status;
- profile edit/update flow after initial approval;
- links between mentor, services, events, and future audience;
- mentor-specific cabinet view with real submitted/published items.

### Submission Review Visibility

The bot can collect submissions, and the database has a `submissions` table. The website admin panel does not need to manage them yet, but the system still needs a clean operational loop.

Missing:

- bot command/menu for admin to list pending submissions;
- approve/reject actions in Telegram;
- status updates in Supabase;
- Telegram notification back to mentor after approval/rejection;
- optional website cabinet visibility for mentor: pending, approved, rejected.

### Booking And Event Participation Loop

The website can request a booking through the database function, but the complete user journey is not finished.

Clarified scope:

- private bookings are not a global website list;
- users see only their own booking status;
- mentors/organizers see counts and private booking state only for their own events/services;
- admin/master sees platform counts and operational health, not casual access to all booking rows;
- public “I will come” participation is separate from private booking and can be shown on event pages;
- if event capacity is limited, the public page can show taken/left places.

### Notification Plan Beyond Reminders

Event reminders work for saved events. More notification types should be planned, but not all built immediately.

Useful next notifications:

- booking requested -> admin;
- booking approved/rejected -> user;
- submission approved/rejected -> mentor;
- new event from saved mentor -> user;
- new date/open seat for saved service -> user;
- discount/special offer for saved service -> user;
- event changed/cancelled -> saved/booked users.

Admin does not need separate website notifications now because Telegram is the admin control surface.

### Club / Resident Value Layer

The role exists, but the value is mostly promised by the site copy.

Missing:

- real club-only events;
- resident-only offers or discounts;
- early access logic;
- cabinet section with actual resident benefits;
- clear path for visitor to become resident;
- visibility rules tested with real resident account.

### Content Layer

Content is intentionally postponed until mechanics are ready.

Future content needs:

- real event/service/mentor content;
- images and media assets;
- published mentor profiles;
- real community/club offer;
- possibly projects/articles/content cards later.

### Deployment And Operations

The local system works, but production setup should be tightened later.

Needed:

- set `PUBLIC_SITE_URL` in `bot/.env`;
- confirm final deployed website URL;
- run bot 24/7 on server or hosting;
- remove or rename test event when real events are ready;
- commit and keep migrations in order;
- add a small smoke-test checklist for login, save, reminder, booking, and submission flows.

## Recommended Next Work

Build the next step as one combined Telegram-first operations plan:

1. Website booking requests create private Supabase bookings and show only the user's own status.
2. Public “I will come” participation is visible on the event page/calendar, including capacity counts when relevant.
3. Submission requests from mentors are stored in Supabase and visible to admin/master in Telegram.
4. Files stay in Telegram; the website cabinet shows only text/status/admin message/final link.
5. Admin/master answers each submission in Telegram: accept, reject, ask for info, or send final published link.
6. Mentor sees submitted/in-work/published/rejected request states in the website cabinet.
7. Mentor sees stats for their own linked events/services: saved count, public attendee count, booking count.
8. Admin/master can switch website cabinet view between admin, visitor, resident, and mentor to test the platform.

This keeps admin work inside the bot, while the website becomes the user-facing status and discovery layer.

## Later Work

After the above flow works:

1. Add mentor public profiles.
2. Add real club/resident content and restrictions.
3. Add saved-mentor and saved-service notifications.
4. Add better content and visuals.
5. Add website admin tools only if Telegram admin becomes too limiting.
